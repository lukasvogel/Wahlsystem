		\item[Scalability] The system must handle the votes of 60 Million Wahlberechtigte on election day. Acceptance criteria \ref{scala}
		After the election has closed, the system has to present analytics in real-time to all interested citizens.Acceptance criteria \ref{ana}
		\item[Information privacy] The personal information of all voters and candidates has to be secure under all circumstances. Acceptance criteria \ref{privacy}
